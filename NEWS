HTPMT NEWS
==========

Version 1.0.3
 * Fixed a possible segmentation fault occuring when using '-b' and '-n' at the
   same time.
 * Illegal characters (namely ':') in the realm string are now properly
   detected by htdigest. Additionally, the string length check is now performed
   before entering the password.

Version 1.0.2
 * File processing now stops after the first record that matches username or
   username and realm is found. Any subsequent records are left untouched. This
   avoids duplicate (i.e. overwritten) records and conforms with the way Apache
   htdigest processes files.
 * In order to avoid issues with files containing both Basic and Digest
   records and in conformance with Apache htdigest, htpasswd and htdigest will
   ony update or delete their respective type of record.

Version 1.0.1
 * Too many or no characters entered at the password prompt or when reading the
   password from stdin no longer causes a segmentation fault.
 * Fixed password verification. getpass return buffer is now duplicated and
   then filled with zeroes so that the password and its verification now in
   fact are placed in different buffers.
 * Additional checks for string length of password, usernames and realms have
   been added in order to avoid buffer overflows.
 * The dist-hook prevented `make dist` to work properly, this has been fixed.
 * version() output has been corrected.

Version 1.0
 * Initial Release
