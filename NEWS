Version 1.0.1
 * Too many or no characters entered at the password prompt or when reading the
   password from stdin no longer causes a segmentation fault.
 * Fixed password verification. getpass return buffer is now duplicated and
   then filled with zeroes so that the password and its verification now in
   fact are placed in different buffers.
 * Additional checks for string length of password, usernames and realms have
   been added in order to avoid buffer overflows.
 * The dist-hook prevented `make dist` to work properly, this has been fixed.
 * version() output has been corrected.
