NAME
----
htpasswd - Create and update user authentication files

SYNOPSIS
--------
*htpasswd* ['OPTIONS'] 'FILE' 'USERNAME' ['PASSWORD']

*htpasswd* -n|--to-stdout ['OPTIONS'] 'USERNAME' ['PASSWORD']

*htpasswd* -D|--delete 'FILE' 'USERNAME'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*htpasswd* can be used to create and update authentification files used by web servers such as Apache httpd, nginx or lighttpd for the HTTP Basic Authentification Scheme.

*htpasswd* is designed as a drop-in replacement for the *htpasswd* program shipped with Apache httpd and provides a superset of its features.

OPTIONS
-------
*-c, --create*::
    Create file 'FILE'. If 'FILE' exists, overwrite it. Can not be used at the same time as *--to-stdout*.

*-n, --to-stdout*::
    Write data to standard output instead 'FILE'. Can not be used at the same time as *--create*.

*-m, --force-md5*::
    Use APR1/MD5 encryption for passwords.

*-d, --force-crypt*::
    Use crypt() encryption for passwords. The use of this option should be avoided at all cost. crypt() is limited to maximum password length of eight characters. Longer passwords are truncated during authenticating without the web browser or user taking notice, possibly leading to false confidence in the security.

*-s, --force-sha1*::
    Use SHA-1 encryption for passwords. This is the default encryption since this is the most secure encryption supported.

*-p, --force-plain*::
    Use plaintext passwords. The use plaintext passwords is discouraged: anybody with sufficient rights to read the authentification file can read the password as it is not encrypted.

*-b, --batch-mode*::
    Use batch mode: *htpasswd* gets the password from the command line instead of prompting for it. The use of batch mode is discouraged as the password is not only visible on the command line and in the users command history, it is also visible in the systems' process table, which is public to all users. Instead use *--from-stdin*.

*-D, --delete*::
    Removes the user record matching 'USERNAME' from the authentification file.

*--from-stdin*::
    Get password from standard input.

*--no-warnings*::
   Do not print warning messages.

*--no-verify*::
   Skip password verification.

*--version*::
   Prints htpasswd version information.

*--help*::
   Prints usage information. 

EXAMPLES
--------
----
# create new file (default encryption)
htpasswd -c passwdfile user1

# add another user record (crypt())
htpasswd -d passwdfile user2

# modify user record (SHA-1)
htpasswd -s passwdfile user1

# delete user record
htpasswd -D passwdfile user2

# in a shell script (unsafe):
htpasswd -b --force-md5 $file $user $pass

# in a shell script (safe):
echo $pass | htpasswd --from-stdin --force-md5 $file $user
