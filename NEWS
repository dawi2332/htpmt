Version 1.3
 * ...

Version 1.2
 * Added support for using OpenSSL instead of the built-in libmd
 for Message Digests. This is an optional feature and will only be
 enabled when 'configure' is called with the flag '--with-openssl'.
 * When called with '--version', htpasswd and htdigest will report
 the version of OpenSSL they were built against.
 * libmd and the libmd testsuite will only be built (and run in the
 latter case), if OpenSSL support was not requested.

Version 1.1
 * Improved compatibility: the length of user records created or
 modified is now restricted to 255 bytes, as Apache htdigest and
 htpasswd (and possibly httpd) don't handle longer records.
 * getpass() functionality, reading from stdin and tty
 detection were moved into a new function: readpasswd.
 * Most custom functions for printing formatted error messages have
 been removed in favor of standard C library functions.
 * Test suites are now based on FCTX instead of autotest and plain
 C.
 * Documentation files and man pages have been updated.
 * Bug-fixes:
   - The dist-hook has been improved and no longer breaks 'make dist'
   - username, password and realm input validation has been fixed.
   - htpasswd will ignore user records created with htdigest and
   vice versa in order to prevent data loss.
   - When updating or deleting a user record only the first record
   matching username and realm (if present) will be modified,
   preventing accidental overwriting or deletion of user records.
   - Fixed a possible segmentation fault occurring when using '-b'
   and '-n' at the same time.
