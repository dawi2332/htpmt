Restrictions
============

For compatibility with Apache htpasswd & htdigest, htpmt restricts user records to 255 characters. Versions of htpmt prior to 1.1 restricted it to 511 characters for htpasswd records or 767 characters for htdigest records.

Additionally usernames and realms must not exceed 255 characters each.
