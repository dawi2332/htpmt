htpmt is a suite of tools for managing HTTP authentication files
that are used by web servers to authenticate users. Currently htpmt
includes tools for Basic and Digest HTTP authentication; they are
designed to be a drop-in replacement for the htpasswd and htdigest
tools that come with Apache httpd.

htpmt is distributed under the terms of the Simplified BSD License
(see COPYING for more information).

A quick overview of htpmt htpasswd & htdigest features:
 * crypt(), SHA-1 and MD5 (aka APR1, a Crypt-MD5 variant) encryption
 of passwords for use with HTTP Basic Authentication
 * MD5 encryption of passwords for use with HTTP Digest Authentication
 * add, update & delete user records
 * output to file or stdout
 * password input from tty, command line (only htpasswd) or stdin
 * uses /dev/random for salt generation when available
 * exit codes and command line options conform with Apache
 htpasswd/htdigest
 * utilizes the built-in libmd library or OpenSSL for SHA-1 and MD5
  message digests

Requirements for building from a source tarball:
 * compiler tool chain
 * GNU make (or compatible)
 * Bourne-compatible shell
 * OpenSSL (optional)

If you checked out htpmt from the repository you'll also need:
 * GNU autoconf
 * GNU automake
 * GNU m4
 * Perl
 * asciidoc
 * fop
 * docbook-xsl (probably)
 * libxslt
 * libxml2

Please see INSTALL for detailed installation instructions.
